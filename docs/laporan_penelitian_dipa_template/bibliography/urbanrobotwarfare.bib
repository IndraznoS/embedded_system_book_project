	abstract = {More than half of the global population is currently under strict forms of social distancing, with more than 90 countries in lockdown, including France. Estimating the expected impact of the lockdown, and the potential effectiveness of different exit strategies is critical to inform decision makers on the management of the COVID-19 health crisis. We use a stochastic age-structured transmission model integrating data on age profile and social contacts in the {\^I}le-de-France region to (i) assess the current epidemic situation, (ii) evaluate the expected impact of the lockdown implemented in France on March 17, 2020, and (iii) estimate the effectiveness of possible exit strategies. The model is calibrated on hospital admission data of the region before lockdown and validated on syndromic and virological surveillance data. Different types and durations of social distancing interventions are simulated, including a progressive lifting of the lockdown targeted on specific classes of individuals (e.g. allowing a larger proportion of the population to go to work, while protecting the elderly), and large-scale testing. We estimate the basic reproductive number at 3.0 [2.8, 3.2] (95\% confidence interval) prior to lockdown and the population infected by COVID-19 as of April 5 to be in the range 1\% to 6\%. The average number of contacts is predicted to be reduced by 80\% during lockdown, leading to a substantial reduction of the reproductive number (RLD =0.68 [0.62-0.73]). Under these conditions, the epidemic curve reaches ICU system capacity and slowly decreases during lockdown. Lifting the lockdown with no exit strategy would lead to a second wave largely overwhelming the healthcare system. Extensive case-finding, testing and isolation are required to envision social distancing strategies that gradually relax current constraints (larger fraction of individuals going back to work, progressive reopening of activities), while keeping schools closed and seniors isolated. As France faces the first wave of COVID-19 pandemic in lockdown, intensive forms of social distancing are required in the upcoming months due to the currently low population immunity. Extensive case-finding and isolation would allow the partial release of the socio-economic pressure caused by extreme measures, while avoiding healthcare demand exceeding capacity. Response planning needs to urgently prioritize the logistics and capacity for these interventions.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis study is partially funded by: ANR project DATAREDUX (ANR-19-CE46-0008-03); EU H2020 grant MOOD (H2020-874850); REACTing COVID-19 modeling grant; EU H2020 grant RECOVER (H2020- 101003589).Author DeclarationsAll relevant ethical guidelines have been followed; any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained and details of the IRB/oversight body are included in the manuscript.YesAll necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

abstract = {With decades of successful application of model predictive control (MPC) to industrial processes, practitioners are now focused on ease of commissioning, monitoring, and automation of maintenance. Many industries do not necessarily need better algorithms, but rather improved usability of existing technologies to allow a limited workforce of varying expertise to easily commission, use, and maintain these valued applications. Continuous performance monitoring, and automated model reidentification are being used as vendors work to deliver automated adaptive MPC. This paper examines industrial practice and emerging research trends towards providing sustained MPC performance.}

Meanwhile, the proposed method does not change the structure of adaptive backstepping controllers, which preserves the advantages of the original backstepping design and avoids increasing the computing effort for the control system.

We propose a control design that provides asymptotic stability of an manifold (also called relative equilibria) - due to the Brockett condition this is the only type of stabilisation possible using smooth time-invariant control laws. The equilibrium manifold can be shaped to certain extent to satisfy specific control objectives. The proposed control law also incorporates integral action, and thus the closed-loop system is robust to unknown constant disturbances. A key step in the proposed design is a change of coordinates not only in the momentum, but also in the position vector, which differs from coordinate transformations previously proposed in the literature for the control of nonholonomic systems. The theoretical properties of the control law are verified via numerical simulation based on a robotic ground vehicle model with differential traction wheels and non co-axial centre of mass and point of contact.},

Unlike previous backstepping controllers for wheeled mobile robots, a backstepping-like feedback control structure is proposed in the form of a cascaded kinematic and dynamic linearization to have a simpler and modular control structure. First, the pseudo commands for the forward linear velocity and the heading direction angle are designed based on kinematics. Then, the actual torque control inputs are designed to make the actual forward linear velocity and heading direction angle follow their corresponding pseudo commands. A stability analysis shows that the tracking errors of the posture (the position and heading direction angle) are globally ultimately bounded and its ultimate bound can be adjusted by the proper choice of control parameters. In addition, numerical simulations for various reference trajectories (e.g., a straight line, a circle, a sinusoidal curve, a spinning trajectory with no forward velocity and a nonzero rotational velocity, a cross-shaped trajectory changing the forward and backward directions, etc.) show the validity of the proposed scheme. © 2006 IEEE.},

Based on the differential geometry theory, we develop a multiple input multiple output (MINO) generalization of normal form using the input-output feedback linearization technique. Then, the change of variables (diffeomorphism) transform the state-space model of WMR, incorporating both kinematic and dynamic models into nontriangular normal form. As a result, the system dynamics can be represented as internal and external dynamics. The nonlinear internal dynamics of WMR pose serious challenges to design a suitable controller due to its internal dynamics being not minimum phase and non-strict feedback form structure. The proposed backstepping controller is designed in two steps. First, a standard integral backstepping controller is designed to stabilize the robot’s orientation angle. Then, a recursive integral backstepping control technique is applied to achieve asymptotic convergence of position error to zero. Hence, both asymptotic posture stabilization and trajectory tracking are achieved in semi-global regions, except the nonzero initial condition of the orientation angle. The asymptotic stability of the entire closed-loop system is shown using the Lyapunov criteria.},

	abstract = {The research contribution of the present work is to solve the path planning and path tracking problems in static and dynamic environments. A new Planning Navigation Algorithm Technique is developed in order to solve the problem of navigation with obstacle avoidance. The basic idea of this algorithm searches for a safe path for navigation. First, this algorithm is focused to identify an optimal collision-free route to a spatially defined objective. Then, in each displacement, the developed algorithm handles to maximize the distance between the obstacles and minimize the distance to the goal. This is to obtain the optimal trajectory for navigation. On the other side, a sliding mode controller is adopted to solve the tracking trajectory task. The basic idea of this control system is to allow the robot mobile to track the desired trajectory with minimum error. In addition, the comparative study between the proposed approach and the previous work is presented in order to demonstrate the satisfaction of the proposed strategy. Finally, simulation results which are developed using Matlab software are presented to show the robustness and efficiency of the developed algorithm and the reactivity of the proposed sliding mode controller.},

abstract = {Hybrid robots consist of both serial and parallel mechanisms, which have advantages in stiffness and workspace compared with serial/parallel robots when machining composite material. However, the forward and inverse kinematics of hybrid robots generally do not have analytic solutions. This paper deals with the analytic forward and inverse kinematics solutions of a 5-degree-of-freedom (DOF) hybrid robot which consists with a 3-DOF 2UPU/SP parallel mechanism (PM) and a 2-DOF rotating head. In the forward kinematic problem, a method is proposed to transfer the high order kinematic equation to a 4th-order polynomial based on the Sylvester's dialytic elimination, and the analytic solutions can be further obtained by Ferrari's method. In the inverse problem, the redundant Euler angles expressed by four rotations are firstly proposed for decoupling different motions, then, the closed-form solution of inverse kinematics can be found. Finally, a simulation trajectory is given, and the result shows that the accuracy of the solutions’ calculation reaches femtometer grade and the efficiency reaches microsecond grade; furthermore, an experiment is performed on the prototype to validate the effectiveness of the proposed forward and inverse kinematics.}

abstract = {Compared to omnidirectional wheel robots and Mecanum wheel robots, four-wheel independent steering (4WIS) robots are more efficient. In recent years, 4WIS robot become the best choice for high-speed maneuverable mobile robots. However, the delay of the steering motor action and the control command exceeding the maximum speed of the steering motor make it difficult for the 4WIS robot to perform high-precision high-speed trajectory tracking. This paper proposes a high-speed trajectory tracking method combining the dynamics of the 4WIS robot. The A* algorithm is used for path planning, and then combined with the robot dynamics performance for trajectory planning. A 4WIS robot kinematics model and a model predictive control (MPC) controller with dynamic constraints are established. Simulations and experiments support the effectiveness and practicability of the trajectory tracking method. The high-speed trajectory tracking control of the 4WIS robot is realized.}

   abstract = {The rising demand for data and its machine-aided dynamics calls for more deliberate effort on standardized collection, especially in formats suitable for identifying relationships between its features. This paper reports the implementation of cloud-based biometric attendance system to address the limitations associated with the traditional attendance system, which is still predominantly in use across institutions in developing countries. The cloud-based attendance uses a fingerprint recognition system for authenticating attendance, displays user identity via Organic Light Emitting Diode (OLED) display and uploads the processed attendance data into cloud with the aid of the ESP32 microcontroller and its development board. At the point of taking the attendance, the system exclusively authenticates and processes the attendance of the preregistered candidates whose fingerprints matches those pre-stored and uploads the result into the cloud for access by the administrator remotely. The system is simple and modular with an impressive performance, recording authentication and loading to cloud at an average of 2-5 seconds per candidate. With this system in place, it would be easier to get the required data to enforce the eligibility criteria for assessment and this invariably would also encourage punctuality and students' participation in classroom activities.},

In the conditions of mixed education, which is related to the pandemic and martial law in Ukraine, the question of how to acquire the knowledge and skills necessary for mastering the basics of developing and programming embedded systems that work with the use of smart technologies and Internet of Things technologies is quite relevant. . In the absence of access to ESP8266, ESP32 IoT modules, students are invited to simulate their work in the Wokwi cloud service. The paper considers the temperature and humidity monitoring system in the DWEET.IO cloud service on the ESP8266 IoT module and the DHT11 combined sensor. Prototyping the operation of such a system in the Wokwi service is performed on an ESP32 IoT module and a DHT22 sensor, with the simulation of data transmission to the IoT cloud service. The article provides the source codes of the temperature and humidity monitoring system program. The proposed approach allows for prototyping embedded systems that work using smart technologies and Internet of Things technologies without the presence of IoT modules and sensors. The Wokwi cloud service allows you to configure the software part of embedded systems and connect to real cloud services of the Internet of Things with the simulation of data exchange via a wireless interface using Wi-Fi technology of the 802.11g standard.},

   abstract = {The Covid-19 pandemic has made online learning the main choice in learning modes. For control engineering education that requires substantial laboratory practices as part of the learning process, online learning is a challenge in itself. It is difficult for students to gain experience and understanding of physical phenomena through online learning. Two approaches are commonly used to provide learning experiences that resembles practices in a traditional laboratory, namely virtual laboratory and remote laboratory. The drawback of virtual laboratory is that simulation eliminate the interaction aspect with physical devices make students miss the mental experiences of dealing with physical objects that important for engineering students, while the remote laboratory requires high cost and less flexible. This paper proposes another approach to overcome the shortcomings by utilizing a technology known as Digital Twin. Digital Twin based laboratory provides digital or virtual twin of a physical system that are interconnected with one another via the internet. The interconnection of the physical system and its virtual twin preserve the physical interaction and also increase the flexibility of the laboratory. Preliminary implementation and experiments show that the propose approach works properly. Users are able to manipulate the real plant remotely, and to observe almost identical dynamics of the real plant and the 3D visualization of the virtual plant.},

Different from conventional pocket laboratories, the M2PLab system has advantages, such as web-based plug-in free access, graphical algorithm design, simulation, code generation, and monitor integration just to name a few. Considering the hardware cost, size, and computing performance, the M2PLab system is deployed into the hardware of Raspberry Pi. Due to the small size of Raspberry Pi, the pocket laboratory can be carried into student dormitories or somewhere else to conduct experiments at any time. In this article, a pocket laboratory package including a Raspberry Pi, a compact test rig and cables is assigned to each student to finish experiments of Automatic Control Theory course. After the experiments, students were asked to fill out a satisfaction survey about the experience of the use of the pocket laboratory.

Nonetheless, the costs and issues regarding their implementation and deployment limit the access of the students and educators to their advantages and features such as technical and educational. In this line, this study describes a fully open-source remote laboratory in hardware and software for education in automatic control systems employing Raspberry Pi and Python language with an approximate cost of USD 461. Even, by changing some components, the cost can be reduced to USD 420 or less. To illustrate the functionalities of the laboratory, we proposed a low-cost tank control system with its respective instrumentation, signal conditioning, identification, and control, which are exposed in this document. However, other experiments can be easily scalable and adaptable to the remote laboratory. Concerning the interface of the laboratory, we designed a complete user-friendly web interface with real-time video for the users to perform the different activities in automatic control such as identification or controller implementation through the programming language Python. The instructions to build and replicate the hardware and software are indicated in the open repositories provided for the project as well as in this paper.

   abstract = {Cyber-physical systems (CPS) integrate a variety of engineering areas such as control, mechanical, and computer engineering in a holistic design effort. While interdependencies between the different disciplines are key attributes of CPS design science, little is known about the impact of design decisions of the cyber part on the overall performance qualities of the system. To investigate these dependencies, this paper proposes a simulation-based Design Space Exploration (DSE) framework that considers detailed cyber system parameters such as cache size, bus width, and voltage levels in addition to physical and control parameters of the CPS. We propose a DSE algorithm that explores the parameter configurations of the cyber-physical sub-system in order to approximate the Pareto-optimal design points with respect to design objectives such as energy consumption and control stability. For validation, we have successfully applied the proposed framework to an inverted-pendulum application. Here, our holistic evaluation of the Pareto-optimal points reveals the presence of non-trivial trade-offs that are imposed by the control, physical, and detailed cyber parameters. For instance, the identified energy and control optimal design points comprise configurations with a wide range of CPU speeds, sampling rates, and cache configurations following non-trivial zigzag patterns. The proposed framework could identify and manage these trade-offs and, as a result, is an imperative first step to automate the search for superior cyber-physical system configurations.},
